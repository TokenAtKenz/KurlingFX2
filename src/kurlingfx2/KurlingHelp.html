				How To Play Krazy Kurling </BR></BR>

			Press NEW GAME, the button will change to SHOOT </BR>
			Press SHOOT after you have set up the shot. </BR>
			After all the rocks are shot, the button will change</BR>
			to SCORE END. Press SCORE END to update the scoreboard </BR>
			The button then changes to NEXT END.  </BR>
			Press NEXT END to reset and start the next end.</BR>
			</BR>	the game keeps track of scoring, hammer and ends. </BR>
			</BR>	pretty much, click the one button to play. NEW GAME </BR> 
</BR>
	There are 4 basic game controls.</BR> 
</BR>
		Rock Positioning</BR>
		Broom Positioning</BR>
		Speed of the Rock</BR>
		Speed and Direction of the Curl</BR>
</BR>		
</BR>		
	using your mouse, the ROCK can be moved left or right.</BR>
</BR>
	The ROCK is always aimed towards the center of the BROOM.</BR>  
	The BROOM can be positioned anywhere on or off the ice. </BR>
</BR>
	The ROCKSPEED is set by the scrollbar on the left side of</BR>
	of the Ice Surface. The speed goes from zero to max.</BR>
 </BR>
	The Curl SPEED and DIRECTION, are set with the scrollbar directly</BR>
	above the Ice Surface. The rock will curl in the direction of the </BR>
	arrow, and the rotation speed will be zero to max in whatever direction is chosen.</BR>
</BR>
	There are no markings on the speed or curl bar, just as there</BR>
	are no markings on the ice or the rocks to set the speed and curl.</BR>
	A big part of the game is getting a "feel" for it. 
</BR>
	There are other buttons:</BR>
</BR>
	Turn Curl OFF/ON : toggles the curl scrollbar. when off, all shots are straight</BR></BR>
	Put Sides UP/DOWN : toggles the side walls between bounce-back AND out-off-bounds </BR></BR> 
	Put Ends UP/DOWN : toggles toe front and back walls.</BR></BR>
	Watch Demo : this will trigger an automated end of curling. Very bad curling.</BR>
			the demo will be created using the existing wall setup, and </BR>
			is rendered as a single new and unique animated sequence.</BR></BR>
	RESET : does a reset. Work in progress as to exactly what ends up being reset
